# Water Stress Data Analysis Project

In this brief project, I extracted real-world data related to Water Stress from `data.worldbank.org` and transformed the initially unstructured dataset into a more organized format using the Python package `pd.pivot_table()`.

## Project Overview

### Data Extraction
I sourced the data from `data.worldbank.org`, focusing on Water Stress metrics spanning from the mid-20th century to the present. The dataset, in its original form, posed challenges due to its unstructured nature.

### Data Transformation
To tackle the complexities of the dataset, I utilized the powerful data manipulation capabilities of the Python programming language. Specifically, the `pd.pivot_table()` function was instrumental in restructuring the data, enhancing its clarity and usability.

## Outcome and Potential Applications

The resulting structured dataset now encompasses essential variables as attributes, delineating Water Stress for each country across various years. This transformation lays the groundwork for streamlined analyses and provides a foundation for further exploration.

## Future Possibilities

The structured dataset generated through this project holds significant potential for research in the field of Water Stress. While the current focus was on structural transformation, the dataset serves as a valuable resource for future endeavors, particularly in the realm of data-driven research.

Feel free to explore the structured dataset and leverage it for research purposes or as a starting point for more in-depth analyses in the crucial domain of Water Stress.
